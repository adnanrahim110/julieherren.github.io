                about a woman’s
                daily existence in the corporate cubicles and fraught families of modern America.

                    otherwise.</b></em>
                A college honors student, all Honey wants is for her powerful businessman Dad to feel proud of her. She
                enters the
                working world with no compunction, starting at the bottom of the totem pole, sharpening the pencils of
                her OCD first
                boss, Mr. Meloso (sweet in Portuguese), who is decidedly NOT meloso.
                <br> <br>
                As Honey rises through the ranks and becomes a formidable opponent, the cutthroat world of business (and
                family) doesn’t
                leave her unscathed. From sexist remarks to handsy bosses and drunk clients to an adored father who
                takes a steep fall
                from grace, Honey lets it all roll off her back—
                <b class="d-block my-3">—But she doesn’t forget.</b>
                And boy does she get her reward. Our girl Honey Malone charges into her future with courage and
                impatience.

              The Seven Bosses of Honey Malone rips the white male privilege out of the hands of the bosses who, for

                underestimated, and undermined

                    A great read and window into the life of a young woman trying to gain respect in advancing her
                    professional career in a man’s world. The character’s trials and tribulations, as she aspires to
                    climb the corporate ladder,
                    are a testament to the challenges so many women face. Honey’s struggle to balance professional and
                    personal life, while
                    striving to find that perfect lover, is sure to resonate with many women today. Peppered with humor
                    and the stark
                    reality of male chauvinism—still alive and well—this book will keep readers wondering if Honey
                    Malone will ever find
                    fulfillment in both her career and love life. I highly recommend this book to any woman who has
                    faced sexism in her
                    life. It also serves as an eye-opener for men who need to look beyond the physical and respect a
                    woman as their equal in
                    business and life.

                    The Seven Bosses of Honey Malone by Juli Herren was a fun, funny and engaging read. The book follows
                    the trials and
                    tribulations of “our girl” Honey Malone from college graduation through seven distinctive bosses and
                    multiple decades,
                    during which Honey learns a multitude of lessons about work, life, love, relationships, betrayal and
                    following your
                    dreams. From her first hilariously OCD boss at a real estate firm to her final (it’s a surprise)
                    boss, Honey grows from
                    a spunky but untried executive assistant to a respected business woman and content creator with a
                    love of life and an
                    inspirational passion for words.
                    As a content creator myself, I’d never before read a novel centered on that profession. I felt so
                    seen as when Honey
                    talked about her time writing for Behemoth Tech’s home page where, though she was viewed as a
                    “subhuman” she found
                    fulfillment in helping create “the stories that made the business come alive.” Honey’s love for
                    language is a theme that
                    spans the book and is evident in Honey’s personal as well as professional life. She keeps track of
                    clever bumper
                    stickers <b>(“When cryptography is outlawed, bayl bhgynjf jvyy unir cevinpl”)</b> and
                    surreptitiously jots
                    her boyfriend’s
                    frequent and hilarious malapropisms on dinner napkins to remember them <b>(“She wasn’t dead. She was
                      just
                      unconscientious.”)</b> Though the book is ostensibly about Honey’s bosses, in reality Honey’s
                    bosses
                    serve more as pins in
                    the map of Honey’s rambling life journey, as she navigates familial relationships, friendships,
                    multiple suitors, and
                    more. The journey is interesting and at times both funny and poignant, making The Seven Bosses of
                    Honey Malone a
                    pleasant and worthwhile read.
